Progress so far:
We've finished all the functional requirements provided from the first meeting with the product owner.
Most, if not all of the frontend code is applicable to the functionality that would have been implemented in the backend
(sprint 2/requirements from second meeting with product owner).
As for the backend code, we have yet to accomplish the finalization of the creation of a reservation.
